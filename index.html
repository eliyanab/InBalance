                <p>My name is Channing Smith-Bump, I am a certified pilates instructor.</p>
                <p>I operate In Balance Aiken pilates studio in downtown Aiken and have been teaching since 2002. I started doing pilates for my own fitness and felt like it was the best thing for my body. The longer I did it the better I felt and looked. I was hooked, so I stated my training and I&#39;ve been practicing and teaching ever since.</p>
                <p>I have trained in many different pilates styles such as Physical Mind, Power Pilates, Balance Body, just to name a few. I have attended many additional courses such as, Active Isolated Stretching, Anatomy Trains, and Barre Pilates, along with exercise physiology. Learning how the body works and moves keeps me motivated. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping people improve their body awareness.</p> 
                <p>My specialty, if I have one, would be with rehabilitation and general fitness. I trained and competed in women&#39;s figure/bodybuilding for many years and also compete in the equestrian sport of working equitation. I love how Pilates helps with my riding. I enjoy combining the physical fitness world with pilates and always strive for keeping the pilates fundamentals in balance.</p>
